This repository provides a Rust crate that allows read-only access to an
[ext4] filesystem. Write access is an explicit non-goal. The crate is
`no_std`, so it can be used in embedded contexts. However, it does
require `alloc`.

[ext4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4

## Usage

Add the dependency:
```console
cargo add ext4-view
```

Basic example:
```rust
use ext4_view::{Ext4, Metadata};

// Load the filesystem. The data source can be be anything that
// implements the `Ext4Read` trait. The simplest source is a
// `Vec<u8>` containing the whole filesystem.
let fs_data: Vec<u8> = get_fs_data_from_somewhere();
let fs = Ext4::load(Box::new(data_source))?;

// If the `std` feature is enabled, you can load a filesystem by path:
let fs = Ext4::load_from_path(std::path::Path::new("some-fs.bin"))?;

// The `Ext4` type has methods very similar to `std::fs`:
let path = "/some/file/path";
let file_data: Vec<u8> = fs.read(path)?;
let file_str: String = fs.read_to_string(path)?;
let exists: bool = fs.exists(path)?;
let metadata: Metadata = fs.metadata(path)?;
for entry in fs.read_dir("/some/dir")? {
    let entry = entry?;
    println!("{}", entry.path().display());
}
```

## Design Goals

In order of importance:

1. Correct
   * All valid ext4 filesystems should be readable.
   * Invalid data should never cause crashes, panics, or non-terminating loops.
   * No `unsafe` code in the main package (it is allowed in dependencies).
   * Well tested.
2. Easy to use
   * The API should follow the conventions of [`std::fs`] where possible.
3. Good performance
   * Performance should not come at the expense of correctness or ease of use.

Non-goals:
* Write support.
* Recovery of corrupt filesystems.
